# Current Projects
### Response of Autonomous Vehicles to Emergency Vehicles (RAVEV)
*Guide - Dr. Sivakumar Rathinam*
- Prepared image and sound datasets for emergency vehicles, and trained Keras classifier
- Integrated detection algorithms with path planning and controls using Robot Operating System (ROS)
- Conducted experiments on high-speed autonomous vehicle (up to 70 mph) to avoid obstacles, and respond to emergency vehicles (EV) in real-time
- Presented research poster at Spring TexITE meeting - 2019, San Antonio, Texas

### Traffic Signal Detection Using Image Processing
- Detected traffic signal using background subtraction, color thresholding and shape filters
-	Used CNN based architecture YOLO for better detecting signals in Indian scenario
- COCO dataset was used for pretrained weights for signals. The dataset was augmented using signals in Indian scenario and transfer learning was used to retrain the weights

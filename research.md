[Curriculum Vitae](/assets/CV_2018.pdf)

My research interests are:

1. Computational materials science

2. First Principle Calculations

3. Atomistic modeling of materials

4. Deep learning and machine learning

5. Phase-field modeling



Currently, I'm working with [Dr. Satyesh Kumar Yadav](https://mme.iitm.ac.in/satyesh/index.html) for my Master's Thesis on the development of atomistic potentials for silver nanoclusters using machine learning. And I am working in [Prof. Alexander Hartmaier's](http://www.icams.de/content/departments/micromechanical-and-macroscopic-modelling/) group under Dr. Napat Vajragupta on structure property linkages. Details of the projects can be found in [projects](https://nkc-137.github.io/projects/) section of my website.


I am applying to universities for the fall of 2019 to further my studies.

### Traffic Signal Detection Using Image Processing
- Detected traffic signal using background subtraction, color thresholding and shape filters
-	Used CNN based architecture YOLO for better detecting signals in Indian scenario
- COCO dataset was used for pretrained weights for signals. The dataset was augmented using signals in Indian scenario and transfer learning was used to retrain the weights
